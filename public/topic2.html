      <h1>Evolution as a Core Theme</h1>
      Evolution is the central concept of biology because it connects all themes of life.
      It explains:
      <ul>
        <li> How organisms share similarities (unity) </li>
        <li> Why organisms differ from one another (diversity) </li>
        <li> How species adapt to their environments over generations </li>
      </ul>
      
      Evolution helps biologists understand relationships, classify organisms, and trace the history of life.

      While a lot of people have observed various organisms, one of the people who first tried to
      explain why organisms change is Lamarck. He said that ...

      <p><b>Darwin's Theory of Evolution</b></p><p>
        
      Charles Darwin proposed <b>natural selection</b> as the main mechanism of evolution.</p>

      <p><b>Key Ideas or Assumptions:</b></p>

      <p></p><ol style="text-align: left;">
        
        <li><b>Variation</b><br />
        
      This is the idea that individuals in a population have differences in traits.</li>
        
        <li><b>Overproduction</b><br />
          
      Organisms produce more offspring than the environment can support. 
      So, eventually there will be a carrying capacity.</li>
        
        <li><b>Competition</b><br />
          
      Because resources are limited, organisms compete to survive.</li>
        
        <li><b>Adaptation</b><br />
          
      Some traits give certain individuals a better chance to survive.</li>
        
        <li><b>Natural Selection</b><br />
          
      Individuals with advantageous traits survive 
      and reproduce more, passing these traits on to 
      future generations.</li>

        <li><b>Descent with Modification</b><br />
          
      Over many generations, populations gradually change 
      as helpful traits become more common.</li></ol><p></p>
