    We can use mathematics to model what happens to populations over time. 
    An easy model is suppose we have \( x_n \) as the proportion of a species in the nth year out of the carrying capacity of its habitat.
    An easy simulation is that the population grows at a constant rate per year. So,
    \[ x_n = r x_{n-1}. \]
    However, this is not realistic as there is a carrying capacity. This is because while organisms grow
    exponentially, the resources only grow by a constant difference per year. This limits the population.
    A more accurate model is restricting \( x_n \), showing the proportion of the population compared to
    the carrying capacity. We can add a factor that 
    \[ x_n = rx_{n-1}(1-x_{n-1}) \]
