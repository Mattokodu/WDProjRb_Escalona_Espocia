    <h1>Unifying Themes of Biology</h1>

    Biology is the science that studies life & living organisms. 
    It includes how organisms interact with each other and how
    the inner systems of organisms work.
    <br><br>
    <b>Properties of Life:</b>
	Characteristics shared by living things. There are seven of them, which are the following:
  <ol>
    <li> <b>Order: </b> An organized structure </li> 
    
    <li> <b>Evolutionary adaptation</b> Traits the improve; survival becomes more common. </li>
    <li> <b>Regulation or Homeostasis:</b> The ability to maintain stable internal conditions
</li>
    <li> <b>Energy Processing: </b> Using energy for activities
 Homeostasis - the ability to maintain stable internal conditions
</li>
    <li> <b>Growth and Development: </b> Organisms growing and following genetic instructions </li>
    <li> <b>Response to Environment: </b> Responding to stimuli</li>
    <li> <b>Reproduction: </b> The production of offspring</li>
  </ol>

  There is a correlation with  <br>
    Largest to smallest:
    <ul>
      <li> Biosphere </li>
      <li> Ecosystem </li>
      <li> Communities </li>
      <li> Populations </li>
      <li> Organisms </li>
      <li> Organs </li>
      <li> Tissues </li>
      <li> Cells </li>
      <li> Organelles </li>
      <li> Molecules </li>
    </ul>

  Despite this, many still argue about whether certain things 
  are considered <i>living</i>. For example, consider whether fire is living.
  You would most likely say it is not living, right? However, if we check
  it using the characteristics of life,

  

  <br>

  <p><b>The Cell is the Basic Unit of Life</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>All living things are made out of cells</li>
  <li>Cells carry out the basic functions of life</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ex. growth, energy use, reproduction</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p><b>Structure and Function are Related</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The way something is shaped helps determine what it can do</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ex. Bird wings are shaped for flight; Red blood cells are shaped to carry oxygen</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<b>Life Uses Energy</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>All organisms need energy to survive</li>
  <li>Plants get energy from the sun; Animals get energy from food</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Homeostasis</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Living things keep stable internal conditions even when the environment changes</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Ex. Shivering and sweating</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p><b>Growth, Development, and Reproduction</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Organisms grow and change over time.</li>
  <li>They reproduce to create new life and continue on their species</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Evolution</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Populations change over long periods because of natural selection.</li>
  <li>Evolution explains the diversity of life on Earth.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Unity and Diversity</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>All living things share common features (like DNA).</li>
  <li>But they are also diverse due to evolution and adaptation.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Interdependence of Organisms</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Living things depend on each other and their environment.</li>
  <li>Example: plants produce oxygen that animals breathe.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Biological Systems</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Life is organized into systems—molecules → cells → tissues → organs → organisms → ecosystems.</li>
  <li>Each level works together to support life.</li>
</ul>
